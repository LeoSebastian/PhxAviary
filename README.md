Python version: 3\
I used 3.6.\
I recommend using Anaconda and creating a new environment.\
\
Simply run the program, and leave it alone.\
\
This program supports more than one wallet.\
E.g:\
\
[main_wallet]\
priv_key = (private_key_1)\
pub_key = (public_key_1)\
mine_only = 0\
\
[wallet_for_my_pet_phoenix]\
priv_key = (private_key_two)\
pub_key = (public_key_two)\
mine_only = 1\
\
Required dependencies / install commands (for Windows):\
python -m pip install web3==4.00-beta.11\
python -m pip install ethtoken
