PHX Aviary Alpha v0.2\
Released 19th March, 2018
\
Created by: Mr Fahrenheit, Norsefire\
\
Implemented in Python. Confirmed working on Python 3.6. Aviary is NOT Python 2.7 compatible.\
We recommend using Anaconda and creating a new environment.\
\
Required dependencies/packages (for Windows):\
python -m pip install ethtoken web3==4.00-beta.11\
\
Simply modify your config file, run the program (python phx_aviary.py), and leave it alone.\
\
This program supports more than one wallet in your config file. For example:\
\
[main_wallet]\
pub_key  = (public_key_1)\
priv_key = (private_key_1)\
\
[wallet_for_my_pet_phoenix]\
pub_key  = (public_key_2)\
priv_key = (private_key_2)\
